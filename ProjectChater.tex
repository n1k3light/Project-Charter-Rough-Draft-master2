 \section*{Abstract}

 The Smart Eraser is a tool created with the express purpose of making the lives of teachers easier, by allowing them to utilize valuable class time in a productive way. It aims to assist teachers who write lengthy, involved examples on a whiteboard while lecturing on the material they want their students to understand. The Smart Eraser will erase the information written on the whiteboard at the teacher's will, allowing them to continue lecturing without wasting precious class time on erasing the board between examples. This will allow students to learn in an environment with less interruptions and distractions, resulting in improved overall focus and retention. \par
 \setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} The project itself, in the simplest terms, is an automatic whiteboard eraser with smart capabilities. The eraser will be on a tracking system that will allow it to cover the x-y plane of the whiteboard's surface, and it will move based on the instructions given to it by the microcontroller it is connected to. This microcontroller will have 4 push-buttons that will be programmed to do 1 of four activities: erase the board using smart processing, erase the entire board from top to bottom without smart processing, stop the eraser's movement in case of emergency, and reset the eraser’s current process in order to send it back to its stand-by position. A camera will be at a fixed location facing the board to allow the entire whiteboard's image to be recorded. The image recorded will go through an image-processing algorithm, which will accomplish one of two things: it will detect the presence of a person in front of the whiteboard, causing the eraser to stop in its tracks, or it will detect the markings on the board and translate their locations into coordinates. These coordinates will then be processed in an algorithm which will determine the shortest path that needs to be taken in order to erase all the markings. Finally, after all procedures are done, the eraser will return to it's stand-by position.

 \section{Introduction}
 The purpose of the Smart Eraser is to allow class time to be utilized for learning. It will assist teachers who write lengthy, involved examples on a whiteboard while lecturing, by erasing the board in between examples while the teacher continues to lecture. This will allow students to learn in an environment with less interruptions and distractions, which will result in improved overall focus and retention of the information being taught. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} The Smart Eraser, in the simplest terms, is an automatic whiteboard eraser. The main deliverable of this project will be an eraser which can move left-to-right on a track, and up-and-down on a linear motion system attached to the track. This system will be able to detect where markings are on a whiteboard through the use of a camera and an image-processing program. The camera will send the image of the whiteboard to a microcontroller which will process the image, detect where the markings are, and convert their locations to a coordinate system that the mechanical aspects of the eraser will be able to read. This coordinate system will essentially convert the locations of the markings into rotations of the stepper motors attached to the tracks, and this will allow the eraser to move. The eraser will then find the quickest route to erase all of the markings, using a sorting algorithm, before returning to its stand-by position. Finally, the eraser will be able to detect an obstruction in front of the whiteboard, specifically the presence of a person, through the use of the camera and motion-detection technology. This will check if there is a person moving in front of the whiteboard, and if there is, the result would be an immediate termination of the process the Smart Eraser was carrying out; this is to ensure the safety of those around the Smart Eraser while it is operating. The figure below shows the rough layout of the Smart Eraser, and the numbered arrows are explained below it.

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The linear motion system with the attached eraser. This will allow the eraser to move in the y-axis direction.
	\item The tracking system attached above and below the whiteboard. This will allow the eraser to move in the x-axis direction.
	\item The text that will be erased. The image of this text will be seen through the camera, and the text's location will be determined through the use of image-processing software within the DE1\_SoC microcontroller.
	\item The DE1\_SoC microcontroller, which will contain the image-processing program, the information on how to move the stepper motors, and the motion-detection program.
	\item The wires connecting the DE1\_SoC board to the stepper motors.
	\item This arrow represents the flow of data from the camera that will be mounted across from the board, to the microcontroller for processing.
	\item The camera that will be connected to the DE1\_SoC board through an Ethernet cable.
	\item The stepper motors (as well as the PCB that will be made for their H-Bridge connections). \\
\end{enumerate} \par


\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} The microcontroller that will be controlling the entire system has four push-buttons which will be utilized in the following way: push-button 0 will erase the board using the smart processing method, push-button 1 will erase the entire board without using the smart processing method, push-button 2 will stop the eraser in the middle of whatever process it was performing until it is pressed again, allowing it to resume the process it was carrying out, or until push-button 3 is pressed, which will reset the system and send the eraser back to its stand-by position. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} Heather Libecki is responsible for being the project manager of this project. She will be researching the DE1\_SoC microcontroller, its relevant components, the ARM assembly language it uses, and the GPIO pin connections it is capable of. She will also be researching the stepper motors, the drivers needed to operate them, and she will be contributing to the creation of the PCB for the H-bridges. Therefore, she will be in charge of all connections to the DE1\_SoC, as well as the connections between the stepper motors, their H-bridge PCBs and drivers, and the additional power needed to make them work properly. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} Chris Quesada will be researching the ethernet communication between the DE1\_SoC and the camera, as well as the datasheet for the camera itself. He will also be researching the image processing program, how to implement it using the C programming language, and how this program will be able to run on the DE1\_SoC. He will then research the motion-detection program, as well as the algorithm for finding the quickest route to the markings on the board, with assistance from Heather. Therefore, he will be in charge of all interactions with the camera and its smart processing capabilities. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} Juan Colin will be researching the SDRAM interface standards in order to save images from the camera to the DE1\_SoC. He will also Be researching the physical mechanical system, its required connections, and the power system that will need to be created in order to allow it to run properly. He will then need to configure the power system so the mobile parts of the project can move the way they are intended to, and he will also be assisting in the creation of the PCBs for the H-bridges that will be connected to the stepper motors. Therefore, he will be in charge of the entire physical mechanical system of the eraser. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} During the project life cycle, there will also be multiple deliverables that will need to be completed and turned in to Dr. Stillmaker. These deliverables will be worked on by all three members of the team to ensure a consistent flow of information throughout all written documentation.
 
 \section{Project Objectives and Success Criteria}

 \section{High-Level Requirements}
The high-level requirements associated with the completion of this project are outlined in the following list. \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} The project should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Be completed with the outlined budget
\item Be implementable within 2 semesters
\item Be complex enough to warrant the title “senior design project”
\item Have significant, roughly equal portions of the project be completed by each team member

\end{itemize}
 
\section{Assumptions, Constraints, and Standards}
Based on the preliminary research conducted on what information, components, and protocols will be useful to know for the completion of this project, the team members wrote a list of their strengths and weaknesses to show what they can each do, and what needs more work. The specific courses with the relevant information needed for this project are also listed. \\ \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} Heather Libecki
\begin{itemize}
	\item Strengths: programming (assembly, some verilog), DE1\_SoC programming, mathematics, debugging, circuit implementation, problem solving, technical writing, public speaking
	\item Weaknesses: circuitry design, coding algorithms, power systems, PCB design \\ 
\end{itemize} \par
\setlength{\parindent}{2.5ex} Chris Quesada
\begin{itemize}
\item Strengths: programming (assembly, verilog), embedded systems, algorithms, brainstorming

\begin{itemize}
\item Strengths: electrical systems, circuitry design, problem solving, power systems, public speaking/relations
\item Weaknesses: programming (assembly, verilog), technical writing and spelling \\
\end{itemize}

Based on this list, the background information that will need to be further researched is: image processing programs, connecting physical devices for the track of the eraser, camera and DE1\_SoC connectivity, PCB design for the stepper motor H-bridges, and other research as necessary. A few possible constraints on the project are the budget funding, the additional power supply needed to make the more powerful stepper motors operate, and the power supply to the camera.

The following list outlines the relevant courses and the material that will be used from them. \\

		\item Development of algorithms, setting up and using interrupts with the microcontroller, interfacing with peripherals on the microcontroller
	\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

More extensive research has also been done on specific parts of the project needed to allow the project to work as intended, and they are listed below.

\subsection{Camera Ethernet Connectivity and Data Transfer}
After further research, the original idea of connecting and powering the camera over an Ethernet connection needed to be modified a bit. In order for the camera to be powered through Ethernet, the connection needed to provide 48V to the camera. Since the DE1\_SoC can only supply a maximum of 5V to any external device, the camera will now be powered through the included 12V 1A power adapter. 
\subsection{Data Storage}
The images taken from the camera will need to be saved to the DE1\_SoC board in order to allow the image processing program to work on them. The SDRAM on the DE1\_SoC board will be utilized, using the load and store commands in the ARM programming language. The coordinate system that will need to be created from the marking locations will also be saved to the memory on the DE1\_SoC, as well as the program that connects the stepper motors to the system as well.
\subsection{Image Processing Program Design}
After receiving feedback, it was decided that it would be an easier route to abandon trying to interface with the DE1\_SoC through MATLAB. This was the initial plan due to MATLAB's extensive image processing libraries. However, it has been decided that C will be more beneficial when using the Altera Monitor program. Further research will be towards learning how to do image processing specifically in C and how detect marks on the whiteboard.
\subsection{Translate Markings to Coordinate System (stepper motor rotations)}
Through team collaboration, it was decided that each stepper motor rotation would represent one pixel length. This would be how a coordinate system can be developed. For example, if the image processing algorithm picks up at mark that is 56 pixels from the left of the image, and 178 pixels from the top of the image, this would result in 56 rotations to the right on the x-axis motor and 178 rotations down on the y-axis motor. Further research and configuration would needs to be done towards how many degrees of rotation of the stepper motor would represent 1 pixel length.
\subsection{Stepper Motor System Design}
The stepper motors themselves will have attachable components to a pulley system, which will move the components on the board. In order to move the stepper motors, specific drivers will need to be attached to them through an H-bridge. This H-bridge will be designed on a PCB in order to minimize odd connections and spaghetti wires in the final product.
\subsection{Microcontroller Involvement}
The push-buttons will be used to enable different functions of the system and use the HEX 7-seg displays as visual feedback for which actions is be carried out. The microcontroller will be the central hub where all components of the system interact.  
\subsection{Shortest Path Algorithm}
In order to find the shortest path between all marks detected by the image processing program, Dijkstra's algorithm will be applied to the array containing the translated image. This translated image will be contained in an array that represents the detected marks from the board. The algorithm will then start at the top left most mark and traverse the array to find the shortest path between all marks in the array.
\subsection{Motion-Detection Program}
Not much research has been looked into for this aspect of the project as it is one of the last items on the GANTT chart. It is assumed that some sort of image processing algorithm will be needed to detect rapid changes in pixels. More research will need to be done. \\

\section{Roles of Team Members}
 Heather Libecki will be project manager of the Smart Eraser project. She has experience with programming the specific board (the DE1-SoC) that will be used in this project, as well as connecting physical devices to it and controlling them via the GPIO ports. This project will be dependent on translating data from the camera into information that the microcontroller will be able to process, and her previous experience with the board plus her ability to learn and adapt quickly will help in that implementation. She is adept at solving problems, debugging and error detection, and technical writing, which will be an integral part in the completion of this project. A solid understanding of the microcontroller full capabilities will need to be further ascertained, as well as how the coordinate system will work in conjunction with the stepper motors, which will be connected to the\par

 Chris Quesada has experience in working with embedded systems and developing code for different applications. This project will be heavy on the software side, involving either C or assembly language to take in data, analyze it, and then send an output. So, someone versed in both programming and interfacing with microcontrollers will be needed. A good understanding of networking will also be needed, because an ethernet connection will be used as the medium between the camera and the microcontroller. He is developing a solid knowledge based on how to interact with networks which can be applied to configuring an interface to communicate with and read data from the camera, which will be used in the creation of the image processing program, as well as the motion detection program.\par

 Juan Colin has experience in working with electrical systems, and physical circuit design. He is proficient in the use of problem solving techniques to create a functioning system with given design specifications. His part of the project will be dependent on learning the physical mechanical aspects of the design, and how the connected parts will be powered. Therefore, he will need to further his understanding of how the parts should be connected in order to ensure the most spatial efficiency, as well as the connection of the power system that will allow all parts of the system to work properly and move the way they need to.
